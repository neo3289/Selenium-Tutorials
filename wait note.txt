Ko nên sử dụng để tìm 1 element ko có trong HTML/ DOM

Nên dùng findElements để tìm element dạng non-present

 * Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is
     * not immediately present.
     * <p>
     * When searching for a single element, the driver should poll the page until the element has
     * been found, or this timeout expires before throwing a {@link NoSuchElementException}. When
     * searching for multiple elements, the driver should poll the page until at least one element
     * has been found or this timeout has expired.
     * <p>
     * Increasing the implicit wait timeout should be used judiciously as it will have an adverse
     * effect on test run time, especially when used with slower location strategies like XPath.
